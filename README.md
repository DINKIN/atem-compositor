> An alternative, Electron-based interface for some of the functions of a Blackmagic ATEM vision mixer.

## Motivation
ATEMs are powerful vision mixers. However, some of that power is hamstrung by an at-times awkward UI.

Specifically, the UI for SuperSources is not very operator-friendly. This program aims to be an alternative UI which smooths out some of the rough edges present in the official first-party ATEM Software Control interface.

## Features
- All SuperSource box features of the stock UI.
- Configure the X and Y position of SuperSource boxes using pixel values.
- Size and position SuperSource boxes using one of 9 anchor points, instead of only being limited to a center anchor point. 

## Planned Features
- Configure Upstream and Downstream keys with pixel values.
- Configure Upstream and Downstream keys with top-left anchoring, instead of center anchoring.

## Installation
Check the [Releases](https://github.com/tipofthehats/atem-controller/releases) page to grab the latest installer for your operating system.
