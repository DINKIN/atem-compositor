## Motivation
ATEMs are powerful vision mixers. However, some of that power is hamstrung by an at-times awkward UI.

Specifically, the UI for SuperSources is not very operator-friendly. This program aims to be an alternative UI which smooths out some of the rough edges present in the official first-party ATEM Software Control interface.

## Features
- Right now, not much. Work in progress.

## Planned Features
- Configure Super Source boxes with pixel values.
- Configure Super Source boxes with top-left anchoring, instead of center anchoring.
- Configure Upstream and Downstream keys with pixel values.
- Configure Upstream and Downstream keys with top-left anchoring, instead of center anchoring.
